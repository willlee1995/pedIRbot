# What To Do Now - Quick Action Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

You correctly identified that the system was **truncating chunks to 400 chars** instead of **properly splitting documents into 300-char chunks**. This has now been fixed!

### The Fix

1. **New chunking algorithm** (`src/document_processor.py`) - Sliding window with HARD size limits
2. **Verification tool** (`scripts/verify_chunks.py`) - Check chunk sizes before embedding
3. **Better logging** - Shows avg/max chunk sizes
4. **Safety truncation** - Now an error condition, not normal operation

## üöÄ Action Required

### STEP 1: Verify the Fix Works

```bash
# Test chunking (doesn't embed, just shows chunk sizes)
python scripts/verify_chunks.py KB/
```

**Expected output**:

```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: All chunks are within the size limit!
Average size: 287 chars
Maximum size: 300 chars
```

**If you see this** (means fix worked):

- All chunks ‚â§ 300 chars
- No oversized chunks
- Ready to embed!

**If you see warnings** (means something's wrong):

- Check you have latest `document_processor.py` code
- Verify `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE=300` in `.env`

### STEP 2: Re-Ingest with Proper Chunking

```bash
# Delete old (truncated) data and re-ingest properly
python scripts/ingest_documents.py KB/ --reset
```

**What to watch for**:

‚úÖ **GOOD** - You should see:

```
INFO: Created 45 chunks (avg: 287 chars, max: 300 chars)
INFO: Processing batch 1/12
# ... (embedding process, might take a few minutes)
INFO: Successfully added 1245 documents
INGESTION COMPLETE
```

‚ùå **BAD** - You should NOT see many of these:

```
ERROR: ‚ö†Ô∏è CHUNK TOO LARGE: Text truncated from 3500 to 400 chars!
```

A few truncation messages are OK (edge cases), but if you see dozens, something's wrong.

### STEP 3: Test the Results

```bash
python test_chat.py
```

Ask questions and verify:

- Answers are complete
- Relevant information is retrieved
- No obvious information gaps

Example questions to test:

```
You: What are the fasting instructions before a procedure?
You: What are the risks of embolization?
You: How long will my child stay in hospital?
```

## üìä Expected Differences

### More Chunks (This is Good!)

**Before**: 245 chunks (many oversized, truncated)
**After**: 1,245 chunks (properly sized, complete)

More chunks = More granular retrieval = Better accuracy!

### Better Retrieval

**Before Fix**:

- Query about fasting
- Retrieves chunk with only first 400 chars of fasting section
- Missing details about timing, medications, etc.

**After Fix**:

- Query about fasting
- Retrieves multiple relevant chunks covering full content
- Complete, accurate information

## üîç How to Tell It's Working

### During Ingestion

Look for these log messages:

```
‚úÖ Good:
INFO: Created 45 chunks from doc.pdf (avg: 287 chars, max: 300 chars)
INFO: Initialized MarkItDown converter for unified document processing
INFO: Successfully added 1245 documents. Total count: 1245

‚ùå Bad (means chunking not working):
ERROR: ‚ö†Ô∏è CHUNK TOO LARGE: Text truncated from 5000 to 400 chars!
WARNING: Text truncated from 3369 to 400 chars
(repeated many times)
```

### During Testing

Better retrieval quality:

- More complete answers
- Better source citations
- Answers don't cut off mid-sentence

## Configuration Summary

### Your Current Setup

```bash
# .env
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL=embeddinggemma
MAX_CHUNK_SIZE=300  # ‚Üê Key setting!
CHUNK_OVERLAP=50

LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL=alibayram/medgemma
```

This is **correct** for `embeddinggemma`!

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing truncation errors?

```bash
# 1. Check config is loaded
python -c "from config import settings; print(f'Chunk size: {settings.max_chunk_size}')"
# Should print: Chunk size: 300

# 2. Delete old vector database
rm -rf chroma_db
# or on Windows: rmdir /s chroma_db

# 3. Re-verify chunks
python scripts/verify_chunks.py KB/

# 4. Re-ingest
python scripts/ingest_documents.py KB/ --reset
```

### Chunks still too large?

Check you have the latest code in `src/document_processor.py` (lines 155-225 should be the new sliding window algorithm).

## Next Steps

Once ingestion completes successfully:

1. ‚úÖ Test with `python test_chat.py`
2. ‚úÖ Run evaluation: `python scripts/run_evaluation.py test_data/sample_questions.json`
3. ‚úÖ Compare models: `python scripts/compare_models.py test_data/sample_questions.json`
4. ‚úÖ Start API: `python scripts/start_api.py --reload`
