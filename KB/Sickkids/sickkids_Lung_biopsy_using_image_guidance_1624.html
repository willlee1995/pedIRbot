<h2>What are the lungs?</h2>
<p>The lungs are a pair of elastic, air-filled organs. They are used for breathing, which involves the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. They expand and contract in size every time your child breathes in and out. They are located on either side of the chest.</p>

<h2>What is a lung biopsy?</h2>
<p>A lung biopsy is a procedure where a tiny piece of tissue is taken from the lungs using a needle. The tissue is then examined under a microscope in the laboratory.</p>
<h2>Why is a lung biopsy performed?</h2>
<p>The biopsy results help your child’s health-care team understand your child’s lung condition and choose possible treatment.</p> </div>

<h2>How is a lung biopsy performed?</h2><p>Lung biopsies are performed by interventional radiologists or surgeons using image guidance. The interventional radiologist uses 
   <a href="/healthaz/other/ultrasound-scan/">ultrasound</a>  and/or a 
   <a href="/healthaz/other/ct-scan/">CT scan</a>  to view the lungs and the area they want to biopsy. A small hollow needle is then guided into the lung, and a few small samples are taken. The samples are about as thin as of a piece of thread, and they are sent to the laboratory for examination.</p><p>A lung biopsy usually takes one to two hours. A small bandage will be put over the biopsy area, and it can be taken off 48 hours after the procedure. Your child will usually not need any stitches.</p> </div>

<h2>Preparing for a lung biopsy</h2>
<h3>Visiting the interventional radiologist before the procedure</h3>
<p>Your child will meet with the interventional radiologist before the procedure. During the visit, you should expect the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A health assessment to make sure your child is healthy and that it is safe for them to have <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/what-is-general-anesthesia/">general anesthesia</a>.</li>
<li>An overview of the procedure, and a review of the consent form.</li>
<li>Blood work to be taken, if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Giving consent before the procedure</h3>
<p>Before the procedure, the interventional radiologist will go over how and why the procedure is done, as well as the potential benefits and risks. They will also discuss what will be done to reduce these risks and will help you weigh the benefits against them. It is important that you understand all these potential risks and benefits of the lung biopsy and that all your questions are answered. If you agree to the procedure, you can give consent for treatment by signing the consent form. A parent or legal guardian must sign the consent form for young children. The procedure will not be done unless you give your consent.</p>
<h3>How to prepare your child for the procedure</h3>
<p>Before any treatment, it is important to talk to your child about what will happen. When talking to your child, use words they can understand. Let your child know that medicines will be given to them to make them feel comfortable during the procedure.</p>
<p>Children feel less anxious and scared when they know what to expect. Children also feel less worried when they see their parents are calm and supportive.</p>
<h3>If your child becomes ill within two days before the procedure</h3>
<p>It is important that your child is healthy on the day of the procedure. If your child starts to feel unwell or has a fever within two days before the lung biopsy, let their health-care provider know. Your child’s procedure may need to be rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Food, drink, and medicines before the procedure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your child’s stomach must be empty before and during <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/sedation/">sedation</a> or general anesthetic.</li>
<li>If your child has special needs during fasting, talk to their health-care provider to make a plan.</li>
<li>Your child can take their regular morning medicine with a sip of water two hours before the procedure.</li>
<li>Medicines such as <a href="/drugaz/asa-acetylsalicylic-acid/">acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)</a>, <a href="/drugaz/naproxen/">naproxen</a> or <a href="/drugaz/ibuprofen-for-fever-or-pain/">ibuprofen</a>, <a href="/drugaz/warfarin/">warfarin</a>, or <a href="/drugaz/enoxaparin/">enoxaparin</a> may increase the risk of bleeding. Do not give these to your child before the procedure unless they have been cleared first by their health-care provider and the interventional radiologist.</li>
</ul> </div>

<h2>On the day of the lung biopsy</h2>
<p>Arrive at the hospital two hours before the planned time of your child’s procedure. Once you are checked in, your child will need to change into a hospital gown and be weighed and assessed by a nurse. You will also be given an opportunity to speak to the interventional radiologist and the anesthesiologist at this time. The interventional radiologist will be performing the lung biopsy, and the anesthesiologist will be giving your child medication to make them comfortable for the procedure.</p>
<p>During the lung biopsy, you will be asked to wait in the waiting area.</p>
<h3>Your child will have medicine for pain</h3>
<p>It is important that your child is as comfortable as possible for the procedure. Your child will receive a general anesthetic for the lung biopsy, so they will not hear or feel anything during the procedure.</p> </div>

<div class="panel-body list-group collapse out" data-propname="PostProcedure" id="article-PostProcedure" role="tabpanel" style="display: none;">
<h2>After the lung biopsy</h2>
<p>Once the lung biopsy is complete, your child will be moved to the recovery area. The interventional radiologist will come and talk to you about the details of the procedure. As soon as your child starts to wake up, a nurse will come get you.</p>
<p>Your child will have a bandage on the biopsy site. This can be removed by you after 48 hours.</p>
<h3>Going home</h3>
<p>Most children who have a lung biopsy go home the same day. This is usually six to eight hours after the biopsy.<br/></p>
<p>Your child will be observed closely for these six to eight hours before being discharged home. They will have a chest X-ray four hours after the biopsy to look for any bleeding or air leakage. A blood test may also be taken after the biopsy to identify any changes in blood levels. If there are any concerns of bleeding, a CT scan may be ordered. Your child may have to be admitted overnight for further observation if their health-care provider feels it is necessary.<br/></p>
<p>If you live more than one hour away from the hospital, it is suggested that you stay nearby to the hospital overnight on the night after the procedure.<br/></p> </div>
