<p>A G, GJ or combination G/GJ tube may be a permanent way to feed some children. For others, it is temporary and may be removed in the future.

<h2>Tube removal  </h2><p>If your child has a balloon-type G tube, you may remove the tube yourself or have a health-care professional remove it. There are several different balloon-type G tubes:</p><ul><li>Halyard Mic-G or Kangaroo G tube</li><li>Foley catheter</li><li>Low-profile G tube (also known as a "button" tube), such as a Mic-Key, Nutriport, and AMT Mini One)</li></ul><p>If possible, remove your child’s feeding tube before bedtime. This will allow the stoma to heal for several hours without feedings and with minimal movement from your child while they sleep.</p><p>Once the tube is removed, stomach contents will leak from the stoma and will continue to do so until the tract closes completely.</p><h3>Removing a non low-profile tube (such as a Mic-G, Kangaroo or Foley catheter) </h3><p>Insert a slip-tip syringe into the hard plastic port and withdraw all the water from the balloon. Remove the tube. You may need to pull with a small amount of force to dislodge the tube.</p><h3>Removing a low-profile G  tube  (such as a Mic-Key, Nutriport, and AMT Mini One)</h3><p>Insert a slip-tip syringe into the balloon port – marked "BAL" – and withdraw all the water from the balloon. Remove the tube. You may need to pull with a small amount of force to dislodge the tube. </p><h3>The following tubes should not be removed at home: </h3><ul><li>Corflo PEG tubes require a general anaesthetic to be removed and will be removed in Image Guided Therapy (IGT)</li><li>Mac Loc tubes can be removed by your G tube specialist in clinic</li><li>GJ or combination G/GJ balloon tubes can be removed by your G tube specialist in clinic</li></ul> </div>

<h3>Stoma and feeding tube tract healing process</h3><p>Your child’s tract will start to heal and close within hours of removing the feeding tube, but it can take more than two weeks to close completely. It will leak during this time. After the tract closes, your child will have a small scar that may look like a dimple or a healed earring hole.</p><h3>How to protect your child’s skin</h3><p>To protect the skin from the acidic stomach contents, apply a zinc oxide barrier cream around  the stoma and continue to apply a gauze dressing over the site, secured to the tummy with tape for as long as it leaks. This dressing should be changed daily or when it is soaked. Do not be alarmed if you see some of the food and drink your child is eating on the gauze. This is normal. There are no food or drink restrictions for your child while their tract is healing. They can continue to eat and drink all of their regular food and beverages by mouth.</p><h3>Keeping the stoma clean</h3><p>Do not submerge your child in water until the tract is fully closed. This means no baths or swimming until leakage has stopped. It is OK to sit in the bath if the water is below the stoma. Swimming can be considered if a waterproof bandage is covering the stoma. Sponge baths and showers are OK during this time.</p><p>It is important to wash the stoma with soap and water daily to prevent 
   <a href="/healthaz/gastrointestinal/ggj-tubes-preventing-and-managing-infection/">infection</a>. Be gentle; do not rub the stoma. Allow the soap, shampoo and water to lightly wash over the site.</p><p>Once the leaking stops, the stoma will scab over and your child will no longer need a gauze dressing.</p> </div>

See your primary care provider if your child is experiencing these symptoms.</p><p>If the stoma is still leaking two weeks after the tube has been removed, call your G tube specialist (at SickKids this is the G Tube Resource Nurse) for further assessment. Your child may need stitches to close the tract.</p> </div>
