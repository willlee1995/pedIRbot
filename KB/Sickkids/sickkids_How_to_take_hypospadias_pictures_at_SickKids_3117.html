<p>If your child has 
   <a href="/healthaz/urology/hypospadias/">hypospadias</a>  at SickKids, part of their medical care will include taking update photos, which will be reviewed at each follow-up visit with the health-care team. Taking photos allows you, your child and their health-care team to either monitor their hypospadias as they grow older or follow your child’s healing process after their surgery. You can take these photos of your child, or your child may take the photos on their own depending on their age and how comfortable they are with the process.</p><p>The photos will be added to your child’s medical record through a secure eHealth service (MyChart) and reviewed during <a href="/healthaz/na/virtual-care-at-sickkids/">virtual visits</a> with the health-care team.</p> </div>

<h2>Preparing to take hypospadias pictures</h2><p>In order to accurately photograph your child’s hypospadias, you will need the following supplies:</p><ul><li>A private room with bright, artificial light</li><li>A flat, comfortable surface for your child to lie down</li><li>A camera on your phone</li></ul> </div>

<h2>Taking hypospadias pictures</h2><ul><li>If you are taking photos of an infant, it is easiest if two caregivers are present: one to hold your child still and one to take the pictures.</li><li>If your child is old enough to lie still, only one caregiver is necessary.</li><li>If your child is old enough to handle a camera, they may also take the photos by themself.</li></ul><p>While taking photos, it is important that your child is lying comfortably on their back with both legs lying almost straight. Make sure all pictures of the penis are close enough to fill most of the frame of the camera and are in focus. You will take a total of three pictures in preparation for each follow-up appointment: </p><div class="akh-series"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h3>Picture 1 – From above (natural lie)</h3>
<figure><picture><source sizes="356px" srcset="/globalassets/assets/hypospadias_topphoto.jpg?format=webp&amp;width=356&amp;quality=60 356w" type="image/webp"/><source sizes="356px" srcset="/globalassets/assets/hypospadias_topphoto.jpg?width=356&amp;quality=60 356w"/><img alt="Smartphone with the camera open held above a child's penis in its resting position while the child lies on their back" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/globalassets/assets/hypospadias_topphoto.jpg?width=356&amp;quality=60" width="356"/></picture></figure>
<p>This picture should be taken from above, showing the natural lying position of the penis. It will help the health-care team to understand how the penis appears in its resting position.<br/></p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h3>Picture 2 – Side (lateral)</h3>
<figure><picture><source sizes="356px" srcset="/globalassets/assets/hypospadias_sidephoto.jpg?format=webp&amp;width=356&amp;quality=60 356w" type="image/webp"/><source sizes="356px" srcset="/globalassets/assets/hypospadias_sidephoto.jpg?width=356&amp;quality=60 356w"/><img alt="Smartphone camera held beside a child lying on their back to get side view of penis. A finger holds the penis up at the base" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/globalassets/assets/hypospadias_sidephoto.jpg?width=356&amp;quality=60" width="356"/></picture></figure>
<p>This picture should be taken from either the left or right side. With your index finger, push down on and pull back from the pubic area above the base of the penis to stand the penis up. This picture helps the health-care team check if the penis curves forward.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h3>Picture 3 – Underside (ventral)</h3>
<figure><picture><source sizes="356px" srcset="/globalassets/assets/hypospadias_frontphoto.jpg?format=webp&amp;width=356&amp;quality=60 356w" type="image/webp"/><source sizes="356px" srcset="/globalassets/assets/hypospadias_frontphoto.jpg?width=356&amp;quality=60 356w"/><img alt="Child lying on their back while caregiver has a finger at base of child's penis to hold it up and holds a smartphone in front" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/globalassets/assets/hypospadias_frontphoto.jpg?width=356&amp;quality=60" width="356"/></picture></figure>
<p>This picture should be taken from between your child’s legs. With an index finger, push down on and pull back from the pubic area above the base of the penis to stand the penis up. Take a picture of the underside of the penis. This picture helps the health-care team check where the opening of the urethra (where urine exits the body) is located.</p></div></div></div><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Always make sure that pictures are taken with the same artificial lights every time (not daylight), and there are no shadows on the penis in the images. </li><li>If a picture is blurry, please retake it until it is in focus.</li><li>Label the image files as follows and include the date that the photos were taken:</li><ul><li>NSURG - No surgery; your child has never had hypospadias surgery</li><li>BEF - Before surgery; your child will be undergoing hypospadias surgery</li><li>AFT - After surgery; your child has had hypospadias surgery</li></ul><li>Additional close-up pictures may be requested by your child’s health-care providers.<br/></li></ul><table class="akh-table"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Example</strong>: Your child has had hypospadias surgery and you took the photos on April 21, 2021.</p><p>AFT_natural-lie_21_04_2021.jpg</p><p>AFT_side_21_04_2021.jpg</p><p>AFT_underside_21_04_2021.jpg</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>How to send the photos to the health-care team securely</h2><p>You will send your child’s pictures through MyChart Messaging. They will be received by your child’s nurse or surgical coordinators. Once the pictures are received and reviewed by the nurse or surgical coordinator, they will be released to your child’s patient chart. You will be able to view the images on MyChart at that time.</p> </div>
