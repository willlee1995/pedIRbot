<p>Part of normal teenage development is the development of sexuality. Sexuality means having sexual feelings and experiences. Having cancer can have a major effect on a teenager’s developing sexuality by:</p><ul><li>changing how a teenager sees themselves and altering their body image and self-esteem</li><li>causing them to feel different from their peers</li><li>affecting sexual development (treatments may affect hormones or how sexual organs function, either temporarily or permanently) </li><li>changing interest in, or desire for, sexual experiences</li><li>causing them to feel a sense of isolation</li><li>affecting a relationship with their partner<br/></li></ul>
<!-- For drugs type article, show the 'Expand All/Collapse All' CTA below the introduction field-->
<p>Treatments for cancer can also affect fertility and lower the effectiveness of birth control medications.</p>
<p>Your teenager will learn about the potential effects of cancer on their sexuality in the teen session on <a href="https://teens.aboutkidshealth.ca/healthaz/oncology/sexuality-and-cancer-ages-14-and-up/">lifestyle</a>.</p>
<h2>Encourage open dialogue</h2>
<p>Your teenager’s health-care team should address these issues with your teenager, but it is also important for you, as a parent, to understand how cancer can affect developing sexuality. Cancer does not stop sexual development, and it doesn’t stop teenagers from being curious about sexuality. However, it may cut them off from opportunities for exploration or from opportunities to learn safe sexual practices.</p>
<p>Many parents and teenagers find it difficult to discuss sexuality together, but try your best to educate your teenager about keeping themselves safe. If you have questions or concerns, talk to your teenager’s health-care team. They have experience in talking about sexuality and they understand the impact that cancer can have on this area of health.</p>
