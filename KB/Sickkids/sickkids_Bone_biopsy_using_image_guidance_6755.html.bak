<h2>What is a bone biopsy?</h2>
<p>A bone biopsy is a procedure to take small pieces from one of your child's bones with a special needle. The small pieces of bone are then looked at in the laboratory under a microscope.</p>
<p>A bone biopsy is done using image guidance by an interventional radiologist.</p> </div>

<h2>Reasons for a bone biopsy</h2>
<p>A bone biopsy can help your child’s health-care provider find out what might be wrong with your child’s bones, diagnose an infection, and/or learn about how your child’s disease is changing.</p> </div>

<h2>Risks of a bone biopsy</h2>
<p>Bone biopsies are usually a low-risk procedure. The risk may increase depending on your child’s condition, age and health, and the location of the lesion.</p>
<p>The potential risks of a bone biopsy include:</p>
<ul>
<li>bleeding</li>
<li>infection</li>
<li>fracture of a bone</li>
<li>damage to an adjacent nerve, muscle, or blood vessel</li>
<li>needle injury to a nearby organ</li>
</ul> </div>

<h2>Visiting the interventional radiologist before the procedure</h2>
<p>Your child will have a clinic visit with the interventional radiologist before the procedure. During the visit you should expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>A health assessment to make sure your child is healthy and that it is safe to have <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/what-is-general-anesthesia/">general anaesthesia</a> and to go ahead with the procedure.</li>
<li>An overview of the procedure, and a review of the consent form with an interventional radiologist.</li>
<li>Blood work, if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Giving consent before the procedure</h2>
<p>Before the procedure, the interventional radiologist will go over how and why the procedure is done, as well as the potential benefits and risks. They will also discuss what will be done to reduce these risks and will help you weigh any benefits against the risks. It is important that you understand all these potential risks and benefits of the bone biopsy and that all your questions are answered. If you agree to the procedure, you can give consent for treatment by signing the consent form. A parent or legal guardian must sign the consent form for young children. The procedure will not be done unless you give your consent.</p>
<h2>How to prepare your child for the procedure</h2>
<p>Before any treatment, it is important to talk to your child about what will happen. When talking to your child, use words they can understand. Let your child know that medicines will be given to make them feel comfortable during the procedure.</p>
<p>Children feel less anxious and scared when they know what to expect. Children also feel less worried when they see their parents are calm and supportive.</p>
<h2>If your child becomes ill within two days before the procedure</h2>
<p>It is important that your child is healthy on the day of the procedure. If your child starts to feel unwell or has a fever within two days before the biopsy, let their health-care provider know. Your child’s procedure may need to be rebooked.</p>
<h2>Food, drink, and medicines before the procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sickkids.ca/VisitingSickKids/Coming-for-surgery/Eating-guidelines/index.html">Your child’s stomach must be empty</a> before sedation or general anaesthetic.</li>
<li>If your child has special needs during fasting, talk to their health-care provider to make a plan.</li>
<li>Your child can take their regular morning medicine with a sip of water two hours before the procedure.</li>
<li>Medicines such as <a href="/drugaz/asa-acetylsalicylic-acid/">acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)</a>, <a href="/drugaz/naproxen/">naproxen</a> or <a href="/drugaz/ibuprofen-for-fever-or-pain/">ibuprofen</a>, <a href="/drugaz/warfarin/">warfarin</a>, or <a href="/drugaz/enoxaparin/">enoxaparin</a> may increase the risk of bleeding. Do not give these to your child before the procedure unless they have been cleared first by their health-care provider and the interventional radiologist.</li>

<h2>On the day of the bone biopsy</h2>
<p>Arrive at the hospital two hours before the planned time of your child’s procedure. Once you are checked in, your child will be dressed in a hospital gown, weighed and assessed by a nurse. You will also be able to speak to the interventional radiologist who will be doing the bone biopsy and the anaesthetist who will be giving your child medication to make them comfortable for the procedure.</p>
<p>During the bone biopsy, you will be asked to wait in the surgical waiting room.</p>
<h2>Your child will have medicine for pain</h2>
<p>Children are given medicine for treatments that may be frightening, uncomfortable or painful. This includes <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/local-anesthesia/">local anaesthesia</a>, <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/sedation/">sedation</a> or <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/what-is-general-anesthesia/">general anaesthesia</a>. For a bone biopsy, most children are given a general anaesthetic.</p>
<h2>How a bone biopsy is done</h2>
<p>The interventional radiologist uses X-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to find the part of the bone that needs to be looked at more closely. Using image guidance, the radiologist inserts a special needle to get small pieces of the bone. These pieces are the width of a thick needle (1 to 3 mm) and usually about 2 to 3 cm (about 1 inch) long.</p>
<p>Usually, two or three samples are taken. The samples are then sent to a lab, where they are looked at closely and tests are done.</p>
<p>A bone biopsy usually takes one to two hours.</p>

<h2>After the bone biopsy</h2>
<p>Once the bone biopsy is complete, your child will be moved to the recovery area. The interventional radiologist will come and talk to you about the details of the procedure. As soon as your child starts to wake up, a nurse will come and get you.</p>
<h2>Going home</h2>
<p>How much time your child stays in the hospital depends on the type of bone biopsy they have had and how they are feeling after the procedure. Some children who have a bone biopsy go home the same day. If your child’s health-care provider has arranged this, your child will be ready to go home two to four hours after the bone biopsy. Occasionally, some children will stay overnight for observation after a bone biopsy.</p> </div>
