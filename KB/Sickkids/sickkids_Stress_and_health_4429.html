<h2>Normal stress vs. too much stress</h2><p>Life is stressful. Our lives are busy with school, work, friends, extra-curricular activities and more, and we can feel like we are just rushing from one event to another. We might often feel like we don’t have enough time to do the things we want to do and spend time with the people we want to see. </p><p>Stress, in the right amounts, can be helpful. It can motivate us to study for an upcoming test or make sure that we get to school on time. But too much stress can make it harder to sleep, get things done and think clearly. This can cause trouble for us in our daily lives.</p><div class="call-out"><div class="asset-video">

<h2>Fight, flight or freeze mode</h2><p>Our bodies have a built-in stress response system designed to signal danger and keep us alive. When that stress response system is triggered, we go into fight, flight or freeze mode. Once in this mode:</p><ul><li>our heart beats faster</li><li>our muscles become tense</li><li>our breathing speeds up</li><li>our digestive system slows down</li><li>our appetites can change</li><li>we are on ‘high alert’ as we focus on the threat or fear</li></ul><p>These changes are all designed to give our bodies extra strength and speed either to confront a threat or run away from it.</p><p>The strength of the stress response is directly related to the amount of danger that someone believes they are in, not the actual amount of danger. The response is helpful in real life-or-death situations, but it can also occur – and be less helpful – in everyday situations (such as doing an upcoming test or meeting new people) if someone finds these triggers more threatening or dangerous than they really are. </p><p>If your body’s stress response system is triggered often enough by everyday events, you might be in a chronic state of stress. This can harm your overall health and wellbeing. </p><p>But there are things you can do to help boost your coping skills and become more
