<p>Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) occurs when a child inherits a gene mutation that prevents their cilia from moving properly (see below).</p><p>Cilia are tiny hair-like structures along the respiratory tract that sweep constantly to clear mucus from the lining of the lungs, ears and sinuses. Once the mucus reaches the upper airway, it can be coughed up or swallowed.</p><p>When someone has PCD, their cilia do not move as they should. This means that the mucus that would normally be swept out of the respiratory tract collects in the airways. Trapped mucus carries dirt and bacteria that can cause repeated infections of the respiratory tract, including the lungs, ears and sinuses.</p><p>PCD is a chronic (long-lasting) disease that needs routine follow-up with different health-care professionals. However, with treatment and regular follow-up, most children with PCD have a good quality of life.</p>

<h2>PCD and other organ systems</h2><p>About half of all people with PCD also have <em>situs inversus totalis</em>. This occurs when the organs in the chest and abdomen are reversed; for example, the heart and stomach are on the right and the liver is on the left. In most cases, this abnormal organ placement is not harmful.</p><p>However, a small minority of people with PCD have organ abnormalities that might affect their functioning and health. These can include congenital heart defects (heart defects from birth), polysplenia (multiple spleens) or asplenia (no spleen).</p> </div>

<p>The most common symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia are:</p><ul><li>recurring ear infections and/or hearing loss</li><li>a long-lasting “wet” cough from birth or infancy, with or without mucus<br/></li><li>recurring chest infections</li><li>wheezing that does not respond to asthma therapy</li><li>nasal congestion, thick nasal drainage or chronic nose infections</li><li>sinus congestion or sinus infections.</li></ul><p>Symptoms usually occur in early childhood, although not everyone who inherits PCD has the same symptoms. </p><p>If symptoms occur in newborns, the first sign of difficulty might be breathing difficulties shortly after birth with a need for oxygen or respiratory support for no clear reason.</p><h3>Recognizing symptoms early<br/></h3><p>It is important to recognize the possible symptoms of PCD early, as this will help your child get a prompt diagnosis. Children with a delayed diagnosis of PCD can experience stigma at school because of symptoms, such as a cough.</p><p>It is also worth explaining to teachers that PCD is not contagious — your child cannot spread it to anyone else. However, if another child has PCD or cystic fibrosis, infections could spread more easily between them. In these situations, children should be separated into different classrooms if possible.</p> </div>

<h2>How is PCD inherited?</h2><p>PCD is a recessive genetic condition. To develop it, a child must inherit two gene mutations, one from each parent.</p><p>In the example in this image, each parent has one PCD gene mutation. This makes them "carriers" — they have the mutation, but they do not have any PCD symptoms. Most parents in this group do not know that they are carriers.</p>
<figure class="asset-c-80">
<picture><source sizes="356px" srcset="/globalassets/assets/pcd_autosomal_recessive_en.jpg?format=webp&amp;width=356&amp;quality=60 356w" type="image/webp"/><source sizes="356px" srcset="/globalassets/assets/pcd_autosomal_recessive_en.jpg?width=356&amp;quality=60 356w"/><img alt="Chromosome chart for parents both carrying PCD gene with mutation" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/globalassets/assets/pcd_autosomal_recessive_en.jpg?width=356&amp;quality=60" width="356"/></picture></figure>
<p>Two carriers have a:</p><ul><li>25 per cent chance of having a child with PCD</li><li>50 per cent chance of having a child who is a carrier</li><li>25 per cent chance of having a child who does not have PCD and is not a carrier</li></ul><p>In other words, their children may inherit two, one or no copies of the PCD gene mutation, as shown.</p><p>If a child inherits a PCD gene mutation from only one parent, they will also be a carrier but will not have PCD. If a child inherits two gene mutations, they will have PCD.</p><p>The risk of having a child with PCD is the same with each pregnancy.</p><h2>How common is PCD?</h2><p>PCD occurs in about one in every 15,000 children worldwide. It is more common in people of South Asian descent, where it occurs in about one in every 2,000 children.</p> </div>

<h2>How is PCD diagnosed?</h2><p>The symptoms of PCD can mimic those of common childhood illnesses. This can often delay a clear diagnosis of the condition.</p><p>If your child has repeated ear, sinus or chest infections, it is very important that their paediatrician take a careful medical history. If they suspect that your child has primary ciliary dyskinesia, they should refer your child to a paediatric respirologist or a paediatric PCD clinic for specific tests.</p><h3>Tests to confirm a suspected case of PCD</h3><p>Your child may have a number of tests to check for PCD.</p><ul><li>A ciliary biopsy involves removing a small sample of cilia from the lining of the nose or airway and, with a special microscope, looking for proteins that help cilia move normally. If the proteins are missing, it could indicate PCD. This test is available only in specialized PCD clinics and is typically one of the first tests performed.</li><li>For children aged five or older, a nasal nitric oxide test measures the level of a gas called nitric oxide in the air that your child breathes out from their nose. People with PCD have very low levels of nitric oxide in their nasal airway. The test is also available only in specialized PCD clinics.</li><li>A blood test can check for the gene mutations that cause PCD. This test does not always provide definitive results, so your child might still need future genetic testing as more information about the genetic mutations that cause PCD are discovered.</li></ul> </div>

<h2>How is PCD treated?</h2><p>There is no cure for PCD, but most children with the condition can have a good quality of life with appropriate treatment and regular follow-up. The type of treatment your child receives depends on their PCD symptoms.</p><h3>Treating the lungs</h3><p>Chest physiotherapy (also known as airway clearance) is the main method to help loosen and clear a build-up of lung secretions (mucus).</p><ul><li>For babies and young children, a physiotherapist may teach percussion (tapping or clapping) on the chest in different positions twice a day.</li><li>For older children, a physiotherapist may teach positive expiratory pressure (PEP) techniques using different devices.</li></ul><p>Your child may also receive a suitable 
   <a href="/healthaz/genetics/cystic-fibrosis-physical-activity-and-exercise/">exercise</a> program to help clear their lungs.</p><p>If your child has a lung infection, they may receive antibiotics orally (by mouth) or through a mask, to breathe in. Sometimes, a child may need to be admitted to hospital to receive intense physiotherapy and intravenous antibiotics (antibiotics through a vein).</p><p>Occasionally, even with the best of care, PCD may lead to severe lung disease that needs more intense treatment. For example, a child might need oxygen treatment at night or during exercise.</p><p>For an individual with very severe PCD (their lungs failing badly) doctors might suggest that they be assessed for a lung transplant. If a need for a lung transplant arises, it is usually not until mid or late adulthood.</p><h3>Treating the ears and sinuses</h3><p>If your child’s PCD-related sinus and ear problems are difficult to manage, they might need to see an ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor. The doctor may recommend nasal rinses to clean the nose and sinuses or even surgery to more thoroughly clean out the sinuses.</p><p>Some doctors recommend inserting tubes to drain the ear passages. This is called a <a href="/healthaz/otolaryngology/myringotomy-and-ear-tubes-care-at-home-after-the-procedure/">myringotomy procedure</a>. This procedure can improve hearing and make it easier to treat any ear infection with a topical antibiotic such as ear drops.</p><p>Some children might need hearing aids to improve their hearing. To prevent speech and language delay, it is important to treat hearing loss as early as possible.</p> </div>

They will have a chance to meet with the health-care team on their own to encourage their learning and independence. This includes understanding their PCD, the medications they are taking, how to refill their medication and how to book appointments. Teens may also receive genetic counselling to help with their own family planning in the future.</p> </div>
