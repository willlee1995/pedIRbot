<p>Balloon atrial septostomy is a procedure to expand an atrial septal defect and improve oxygenation of the blood. It is often performed for infants with certain types of congenital heart disease (CHD) such as transposition of the great arteries.<br/></p></p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>A balloon atrial septostomy is a procedure that will help your baby’s body get oxygen-rich blood.</li>
<li>A balloon atrial septostomy enlarges the foramen ovale (the hole between the left and right atrium). This allows blood from both sides of the heart to mix together.</li>
<li>A balloon atrial septostomy is usually performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit, guided by ultrasound, or in a special procedure room called the cardiac catheterization laboratory.</li>

<p>Most babies with <a href="/healthaz/cardiology/transposition-of-the-great-arteries-tga/">transposition of the great arteries</a> (TGA) will need to undergo a procedure called balloon atrial septostomy.</p>
<!-- For drugs type article, show the 'Expand All/Collapse All' CTA below the introduction field-->
<h2>What is balloon atrial septostomy and why is it done?</h2>
<p>In TGA, because the aorta and the pulmonary arteries are switched, there are two disconnected blood circulations: the oxygen-rich ("red") blood flows only to the lungs while the oxygen-poor ("blue") blood circulates through the heart and the body.</p>
<p>A balloon atrial septostomy enlarges a naturally occurring hole (called the <a href="/healthaz/cardiology/the-circulatory-system-before-and-after-birth/">foramen ovale</a>) between the <a href="/healthaz/cardiology/the-normal-heart/">left and right atria</a>. Because blood from both sides of the heart can now mix together, oxygen can be delivered to the rest of the body.</p>
<p>This is only a temporary measure until a baby is ready for a surgery called the <a href="/healthaz/cardiology/arterial-switch-procedure/">arterial switch operation</a>, which will create a normal circulation of blood in the body.</p>

<figcaption class="asset-image-caption">A catheter with a deflated balloon at its tip is led to the heart through a blood vessel in the leg or the umbilical cord. 1) The catheter enters the left atrium of the heart through a normal fetal hole (foramen ovale) between the left and right atrium. 2) The catheter’s balloon is inflated and pulled through the hole back into the right atrium. This makes the hole larger. 3) The balloon catheter is deflated and removed from the heart. The enlarged hole allows blood from both atria to mix, which increases the oxygen level in the blood going to the body.</figcaption>

<h2>How is balloon atrial septostomy done?</h2>
<p>This procedure is done by a cardiologist who specializes in catheter procedures, often assisted by a cardiology fellow. The balloon atrial septostomy is usually performed in the baby’s room, at the bedside, in the cardiac critical care unit (CCCU). The health-care team uses images produced by ultrasounds to guide the procedure.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, if the echocardiogram hints at a more difficult procedure, the balloon atrial septostomy may be carried out in in a special procedure room called the cardiac catheterization laboratory.</p>
<p>A special catheter that has a balloon attached to its tip is introduced into the body through a blood vessel in the groin or belly button. Once the catheter is pushed all the way to the left atrium of the heart, the balloon tip is inflated and pulled into the right atrium of the heart. By gently tearing some of the muscle that divides these two atria, the small foramen ovale becomes bigger.</p>
<p>The balloon is then deflated and the catheter is removed from the body. If the catheter was pushed through the groin, your baby will have a small incision (cut) covered with a bandage.</p>
<p>In some cases, there is no foramen ovale. Your child’s health-care team may judge it necessary to create one with a special catheter in addition to the balloon. This special procedure will be performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory where different equipment and imaging tools may be required.</p>
<p>Your baby will be under anesthesia for the procedure.</p>
<h2>Risks of balloon atrial septostomy</h2>
<p>A balloon atrial septostomy is considered a low-risk procedure. The risks may depend on your baby’s overall health. Risks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>bruising at the groin</li>
<li>blood clot</li>
<li>infection</li>
<li>bleeding</li>
<li>arrhythmia (arrhythmia refers to a fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat)</li>
<li>stroke with TGA</li>
</ul>
<h2>Giving consent before a balloon atrial septostomy</h2>
<p>One of the heart specialists will explain the procedure to you. The <a href="/healthaz/cardiology/the-health-care-teams-for-children-with-heart-disease/"> anesthesiologist</a> will also speak to you. You are encouraged to ask questions so that you understand the procedure. You will then be asked to sign a <a href="/healthaz/na/consent-capacity-and-medical-decision-making-for-children/">consent</a> form before the procedure.</p>
<h2>Pre-procedure</h2>
<p>Newborns must be fasting (not be fed) before the procedure is done. It is possible to <a href="/healthaz/neonatology/expressing-breast-milk-for-your-hospitalized-baby/">save breastmilk</a> to feed your baby later.</p>
<p>If your newborn is not already on a breathing machine, the medical team looking after your baby will arrange for this so that the procedure can be done safely.</p>
<h2>Pain</h2>
<p>Your baby will receive pain medication and <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/sedation/">sedation</a> before and during the procedure.</p>
<h2>After the procedure</h2>
<p>After the procedure, your baby will be allowed to wake up and slowly come off of the breathing machine if they are breathing well on their own.</p>
<p>If the oxygen levels are good, your child’s health-care team will try to stop the prostaglandin medicine.</p>
