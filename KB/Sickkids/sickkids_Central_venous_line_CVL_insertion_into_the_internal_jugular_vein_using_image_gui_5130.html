<h2>What is a CVL?</h2>
<p>A central venous line (CVL) is a type of intravenous (IV) line. A CVL is a long, soft, thin, flexible tube that is inserted into a large vein. You might also hear a CVL called a central line or a central venous catheter.</p>
<h2>Why is a CVL inserted into the internal jugular vein?</h2>

<figcaption class="asset-image-caption">A central venous line is a tube that is inserted into one of the large veins leading to the heart.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A CVL inserted into the internal jugular vein is used in children who need IV therapy for a long period of time. IV therapy can include medications, chemotherapy and IV fluids.</p>
<p>Regular IV lines are usually inserted into a vein in the hand, arm, foot or leg. A child who needs IV therapy for a long period of time would need to have a regular IV line inserted quite often. This can be painful and damaging to a child's veins.</p>
<p>Having a CVL inserted makes it easier and more comfortable for your child to receive IV therapies. If your child has a CVL inserted to receive IV therapy then it can also be used to take blood samples, for total parental nutrition (TPN), and for some treatments such as dialysis and stem cell collection.</p>
<h2>Where can CVLs be inserted?</h2>
<p>CVLs are inserted at femoral, subclavian and internal jugular sites. The internal jugular vein is the most common site used in children when the line will be in place for longer than seven to 14 days.</p> </div>

<h2>How are CVL’s inserted into the internal jugular vein?</h2>
<p>The CVL is inserted using image guidance by an interventional radiologist, but it can also be inserted by a surgeon in the operating room or by an intensivist in an intensive care unit.</p>
<p>For CVLs that are inserted by an interventional radiologist, the tip of the catheter is inserted into a vein in the neck (internal jugular vein) with the assistance of <a href="/healthaz/other/ultrasound-scan/">ultrasound</a> and an X-ray called fluoroscopy. The catheter is guided through the veins until it is positioned in the large vein (superior vena cava) leading to the heart, where blood flow is fast. This placement allows for better mixing of medicines and IV fluids. The rest of the CVL is tunneled under the skin, from the neck to the chest area.</p>
<p>A chest X-ray may also be done after the procedure to check the placement of the CVL.</p> </div>

<h2>Risks of a CVL insertion</h2><p>A CVL insertion is usually a low-risk procedure. The risk may increase depending on your child’s condition, age and health.</p><p>The risks of any CVL insertion can include:</p><ul><li>failure to find an open vein that will accept the CVL</li><li>bleeding or bruising</li><li>pain or discomfort</li><li>infection</li><li>clotting</li><li>air in the lungs or veins</li><li>irregular heart rhythm</li><li>breakage of the catheter</li><li>movement of the catheter</li><li>X-ray exposure<br/></li><li>vein perforation</li><li>nerve or artery damage</li></ul> </div>

<h2>Preparing for a CVL insertion</h2>
<p>If your child is already in the hospital, you will meet a nurse from the Vascular Access Service who will explain the procedure and answer your questions. If your child is an outpatient, the health-care team looking after your child will explain the procedure to you.</p>
<h3>Giving consent before the procedure</h3>
<p>Before the procedure, the interventional radiologist or nurse practitioner will go over how and why the procedure is done, as well as the potential benefits and risks. They will also discuss what will be done to reduce these risks and will help you weigh the benefits against them. It is important that you understand all these potential risks and benefits of the CVL insertion and that all your questions are answered. If you agree to the procedure, you can give consent for treatment by signing the consent form. A parent or legal guardian must sign the consent form for young children. The procedure will not be done unless you give your consent.</p>
<h3>How to prepare your child for the procedure</h3>
<p>Before any treatment, it is important to talk to your child about what will happen. When talking to your child, use words they can understand. Let your child know that medicines will be given to them to make them feel comfortable during the procedure.</p>
<p>Children feel less anxious and scared when they know what to expect. Children also feel less worried when they see their parents are calm and supportive.</p>
<h3>Food, drink, and medicines before the procedure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your child’s stomach must be empty prior and during <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/sedation/">sedation</a> or <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/what-is-general-anesthesia/">general anesthetic</a>.</li>
<li>If your child has special needs during fasting, talk to their health-care provider to make a plan.</li>
<li>Your child can take their regular morning medicine with a sip of water two hours before the procedure.</li>
<li>Medicines such as <a href="/drugaz/asa-acetylsalicylic-acid/">acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)</a>, <a href="/drugaz/naproxen/">naproxen</a> or <a href="/drugaz/ibuprofen-for-fever-or-pain/">ibuprofen</a>, <a href="/drugaz/warfarin/">warfarin</a>, or <a href="/drugaz/enoxaparin/">enoxaparin</a> may increase the risk of bleeding. Do not give these to your child before the procedure unless they have been cleared first by their health-care provider and the interventional radiologist.</li>

<h2>On the day of CVL insertion into the internal jugular vein</h2>
<h3>Your child will have medicine for pain</h3>
<p>It is important that your child is as comfortable as possible for the procedure. Your child will receive a general anesthetic for the CVL insertion, so they will not hear or feel anything during the procedure.</p>
<p>During the procedure, you will be asked to wait in the waiting area.</p> </div>

<h2>After CVL insertion into the internal jugular vein</h2>
<p>Once the CVL insertion is complete, your child will be moved to the recovery area. The interventional radiologist will come and talk to you about the details of the procedure. As soon as your child starts to wake up, a nurse will come get you.</p>
<p>The CVL can be used right away for your child's medication or fluids. Your child should not feel any pain when the CVL is being used.</p>
<p>How much time your child stays in the hospital depends on the reason for the CVL insertion and on how your child is feeling after the procedure. Some children who have a CVL go home two hours after the procedure. Others remain in the hospital to receive additional treatment.</p> </div>

<h2>How long can the internal jugular vein CVL stay in?</h2>
<p>A CVL can stay in for months or years, as long as it remains problem-free and working well.</p>
<h2>Removing the internal jugular vein CVL</h2>
<p>Once your child's health-care team is confident that the CVL is no longer needed, they will plan for the CVL to be removed. CVLs are removed under sedation or general anesthesia. This procedure typically takes 30 minutes. Eating and drinking restrictions on the day of the procedure are the same as when the CVL was inserted.</p> </div>
