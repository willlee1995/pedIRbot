<p>This guide was developed to help people who are making any health-related decision, such as whether or not to have scoliosis surgery. If you are a teen, work through the guide and talk to your parents about what you discover. If you are a parent, help your teen to work through the guide.</p> </div>

<p>You will be guided through four steps:<br/></p>
<ol>
<li>Clarify the decision.</li>
<li>Identify your decision-making needs.</li>
<li>Explore your needs.<br/></li>
<li>Plan the next steps.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. Clarify the decision</h2>
<table class="akh-table">
<tbody>

<tr>
<th>What is your reason for making this decision?</th>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>When does this decision have to be made?</th>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>How far along are you with your decision?</th>
<td>
<p>□ I have not yet thought about options.</p>
<p>□ I am considering the options.</p>
<p>□ I am close to choosing an option.</p>
<p>□ I have already made a choice.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Are you leaning toward a specific option?</th>
<td>
<p>□ Yes □ No</p>
<p>If yes, which option:</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>​</p>
<h2>2. Identify your decision-making needs</h2>
<table class="akh-table">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2">A. Support</th>

</table>
<p>​</p>
<p>People who answer "No" to one or several questions are more likely to delay their decision, change their mind, feel regret about their choice, or blame others for bad outcomes. Therefore, it is important to work through steps 3 and 4 that focus on your needs.</p>
<h2>3. Explore your needs</h2>
<h3>A. Support</h3>

<p>What role do you prefer in making your choice?</p>
<ul>
<li>I prefer to share the decision with ___________________________________.</li>
<li>I prefer to decide myself after hearing the views of ____________________.</li>
<li>I prefer that someone else decides. Who? _____________________________.</li>
</ul>
<h3>B. Knowledge</h3>
<p>In the balance scale below, list the options and main benefits and risks that you already know. Underline the benefits and risks that you think are most likely to happen.<br/></p>
<h3>C. Values</h3>
<p>Use stars (*) to show how much each benefit and risk matters to you. Five stars mean that it matters "a lot." No star means "not at all."</p>
<h3>D. Certainty</h3>
<p>Circle the option with the benefits that matter most to you and that are most likely to happen. Avoid the option with the risks that are most important to avoid.</p>
