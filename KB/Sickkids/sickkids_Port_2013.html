<h2>What is a port?</h2>
<p>A port is a type of intravenous (IV) line that is placed completely inside the body.</p>
<p>A port consists of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first part is the port itself. This is a small chamber made of metal, with a soft silicone top. It lies just under your child’s skin. Your child will receive IV therapy by having a needle inserted through the skin into the port.</li>
<li>The second part is a long, soft, thin, flexible tube called a catheter. One end of the catheter is attached to the port and the other end is inserted into one of the large veins that leads to the heart.</li>
</ul>
<p>The port and the catheter allow medicine to be delivered directly into the blood.</p>

<h2>Why is a port inserted?</h2>
<p>A port is used in some children who need IV therapy for a long period of time. IV therapy can include medications such as chemotherapy, and IV nutrition and fluids. Your child may also need a port because there are some medications that cannot be given through a regular IV line. Having a port inserted makes it easier and more comfortable for your child to receive these IV therapies. If your child has a port inserted to receive IV therapies, it can also be used to take blood samples.</p>
<h2>How is a port inserted?<br/></h2>
<p>A port is inserted using image guidance by an interventional radiologist. During the procedure, the tip of the catheter is inserted into a vein in the neck with the assistance of <a href="/healthaz/other/ultrasound-scan/">ultrasound</a> or an X-ray called fluoroscopy. The catheter is guided through the veins until it is positioned in the large vein just above the heart, where blood flow is fast.</p>
<p>The other end of the catheter is tunneled under the skin a short distance to a space called the pocket, which is created by a small incision. The pocket is where the port sits, under the skin. The tissue and skin are then stitched closed. The stitches used will dissolve and do not require removal.</p>
<p>A chest X-ray may be taken after the procedure to make sure the port is in the correct position.</p>
<p>It will take about one to 1.5 hours to insert the port.<br/></p> </div>

<h2>Risks of a port insertion for your child</h2><p>A port insertion is usually considered a low-risk procedure. The risks of the procedure will vary depending on your child’s condition, age and health.</p><p>The risks of a port insertion include:</p><ul><li>failure to find an open vein that will accept the port catheter</li><li>bleeding or bruising</li><li>pain or discomfort</li><li>infection</li><li>clotting</li><li>air in the lungs or veins</li><li>irregular heart rhythm</li><li>breakage of the catheter</li><li> movement of the catheter</li><li>X-ray exposure</li><li>vein perforations</li><li>nerve or artery damage</li></ul> </div>

<h2>Preparing for a port insertion</h2>
<p>If your child is already in the hospital, you will meet a nurse from the Vascular Access Service who will explain the procedure and answer your questions. If your child is an outpatient, the health-care team looking after your child will explain the procedure to you.</p>
<h3>Giving consent before the procedure</h3>
<p>Before the procedure, a member of the interventional radiology team will go over how and why the procedure is done, as well as the potential benefits and risks. They will also discuss what will be done to reduce these risks and will help you weigh the benefits against them. It is important that you understand all these potential risks and benefits of the port insertion and that all your questions are answered. If you agree to the procedure, you can give consent for treatment by signing the consent form. A parent or legal guardian must sign the consent form for young children. The procedure will not be done unless you give your consent.</p>
<h3>How to prepare your child for the procedure</h3>
<p>Before any treatment, it is important to talk to your child about what will happen. When talking to your child, use words they can understand. Let your child know that medicines will be given to make them feel comfortable during the procedure.</p>
<p>Children feel less anxious and scared when they know what to expect. Children also feel less worried when they see their parents are calm and supportive.</p>
<h3>Food, drink, and medicines before the procedure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your child’s stomach must be empty prior and during general anesthetic.</li>
<li>If your child has special needs during fasting, talk to their health-care provider to make a plan.</li>
<li>Your child can take their regular morning medicine with a sip of water two hours before the procedure.</li>
<li>Medicines such as <a href="/drugaz/asa-acetylsalicylic-acid/">acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)</a>, <a href="/drugaz/naproxen/">naproxen</a> or <a href="/drugaz/ibuprofen-for-fever-or-pain/">ibuprofen</a>, <a href="/drugaz/warfarin/">warfarin</a>, or <a href="/drugaz/enoxaparin/">enoxaparin</a> may increase the risk of bleeding. Do not give these to your child before the procedure unless they have been cleared first by their health-care provider and the interventional radiologist.</li>

<h2>On the day of the port insertion</h2>
<h3>Your child will have medicine for pain</h3>
<p>It is important that your child is as comfortable as possible for the procedure. Your child will receive a <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/what-is-general-anesthesia/">general anesthetic</a> for the port insertion, so they will not hear or feel anything during the procedure.</p>
<p>During the port insertion, you will be asked to wait in the waiting area.<br/></p> </div>

<h2>How long can the port stay in?</h2>
<p>A port can stay in for months or years, as long as it remains problem-free and working well.</p>
<h2>Removing the port</h2>
<p>Once your child's health-care team is confident that the port is no longer needed, they will plan to have it removed. Ports are removed under general anesthetic. This procedure takes about one hour. Eating and drinking restrictions are the same as when the port was inserted.</p> </div>
