<h2>What is a myelogram</h2>
<p>A myelogram is a test to see if there are any problems with the spine, spinal cord or the surrounding structures. The procedure uses a special dye called contrast, which makes the nerves and spinal cord in the spinal canal show up on X-ray.</p>
<p>Myelograms are done using image guidance by interventional radiologists.</p> </div>

<h2>Risks of a myelogram for your child</h2>
<p>Myelograms are usually considered low-risk procedures. The risk may increase depending on your childâ€™s condition, age and health.</p>
<p>The risks of a myelogram include:</p>
<ul>
<li>infection</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>leakage at the site of the needle insertion</li>
<li>change in sensation or numbness in the lower limbs</li>
<li>difficulty peeing or having unexpected accidents after the procedure</li>
<li>nausea and vomiting</li>
</ul> </div>

<h2>Giving consent before the procedure</h2>
<p>Before the procedure, the interventional radiologist will go over how and why the procedure is done, as well as the potential benefits and risks. They will also discuss what will be done to reduce these risks, and will help you weigh any benefits against the risks. It is important that you understand all of these potential risks and benefits of the myelogram and that all of your questions are answered. If you agree to the procedure, you can give consent by signing the consent form. A parent or legal guardian must sign the consent form for young children. The procedure will not be done unless you give your consent.</p>
<h2>How to prepare your child for the procedure</h2>
<p>Before any treatment, it is important to talk to your child about what will happen. When talking to your child, use words they can understand. Let your child know that medicines will be given to make them feel comfortable during the procedure.</p>
<p>Children feel less anxious and scared when they know what to expect. Children also feel less worried when they see their parents are calm and supportive.</p>
<h2>If your child becomes ill within two days before the procedure</h2>
<p>It is important that your child is healthy on the day of their procedure. If your child starts to feel unwell or has a fever within two days before the myelogram, let their health-care provider know. Your child's procedure may need to be rescheduled.</p>
<h2>Food, drink, and medicines before the procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sickkids.ca/VisitingSickKids/Coming-for-surgery/Eating-guidelines/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Your childâ€™s stomach must be empty</a> before sedation or general anaesthetic.</li>
<li>If your child has special needs during fasting, talk to their health-care provider to make a plan.</li>
<li>Your child can take their regular morning medicine with a sip of water two hours before the procedure.</li>
<li>Medicines such as <a href="/drugaz/asa-acetylsalicylic-acid/">acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)</a>, <a href="/drugaz/naproxen/">naproxen</a> or <a href="/drugaz/ibuprofen-for-fever-or-pain/">ibuprofen</a>, <a href="/drugaz/warfarin/">warfarin</a>, or <a href="/drugaz/enoxaparin/">enoxaparin</a> may increase the risk of bleeding. Do not give these to your child before the procedure unless they have been cleared first by their health-care provider and the interventional radiologist.</li>

<h2>On the day of the myelogram</h2>
<p>Arrive at the hospital two hours before the planned time of your childâ€™s procedure. Once you are checked in, your child will be dressed in a hospital gown, weighed, and assessed by a nurse. You will also be able to speak to the interventional radiologist who will be doing the myelogram and the anaesthetist who will be giving your child medication to make them comfortable for the procedure.</p>
<p>During the myelogram, you will be asked to wait in the waiting area.</p>
<h2>Your child will have medicine for pain</h2>
<p>Children are given medicine for treatments that may be frightening, uncomfortable, or painful. This includes <a>local anaesthesia</a>, <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/sedation/">sedation</a> or <a href="/healthaz/pain/anaesthesia/what-is-general-anesthesia/">general anaesthesia</a>. For myelograms, most children are given a general anaesthetic.</p>
<h2>How a myelogram is done</h2>
<p>The interventional radiologist uses X-rays to identify the part of the spine where a needle will be inserted. Once the needle is inserted, X-ray dye called contrast, is injected into the spinal canal. The examination table that your child is lying on will then be tilted to allow the dye to move along the entire spinal canal. Once this is completed, your child will have X-rays and a computed tomography (CT) scan to look at their spine.</p>
<p>Your child will not need any stitches. Your child will have a small bandage where the needle was inserted that can be removed after 24 hours.<br/></p>
<p>This procedure should take 60 minutes.</p>

<h2>After the myelogram</h2>
<p>Once the myelogram is complete, your child will be moved to the recovery area. The interventional radiologist will come and talk to you about the details of the procedure. As soon as your child starts to wake up, a nurse will come and get you.</p>
<h2>Pain after the myelogram</h2>
<p>Your child may have some discomfort in their back immediately after the myelogram. If this happens, your child will be given pain medicine.</p>
<p>At home, you can give your child <a href="/drugaz/acetaminophen/">acetaminophen</a> if needed or medications as prescribed by their health-care provider.</p>
<p>For more details on how to care for your child after a myelogram, see <a href="/healthaz/other/myelogram-caring-for-your-child-at-home-after-the-procedure/">Myelogram: Caring for your child at home after the procedure</a>.</p>
<h2>Going home</h2>
<p>In most cases, children can go home the same day as the procedure. If your childâ€™s health-care provider has arranged this, your child will be ready to go home about four hours after the procedure, depending on the effects of the anaesthesia. Your childâ€™s nurse will let you know when they are well enough to go home.</p> </div>
