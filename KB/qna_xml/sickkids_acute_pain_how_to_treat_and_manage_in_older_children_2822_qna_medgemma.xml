      <answer>**Why is this acute‑pain treatment being recommended for your child?**

I know that hearing “pain treatment” can feel overwhelming, especially when you’re already worried about your child’s health. The plan we’re suggesting is based on what we know works best for kids who are 6‑12 years old and who are dealing with sudden, intense pain—whether it’s after a medical procedure, an injury, or a short‑term illness.

### 1. Pain isn’t just a feeling – it’s a signal that can change how a child feels and behaves
- **Physical impact**: Uncontrolled pain can keep a child from moving, sleeping, or eating, which slows healing.
- **Psychological impact**: Pain can trigger fear, anxiety, or frustration. In older children, these emotions can feel especially intense because they’re learning to manage their own feelings.
- **Developmental impact**: Children in this age group are beginning to think about how they cope with challenges. If pain is not addressed, it can become a source of ongoing stress that affects school, friendships, and self‑esteem.
