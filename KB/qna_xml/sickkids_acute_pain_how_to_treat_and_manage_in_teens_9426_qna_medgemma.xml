      <question>Why is the treatment being recommended for my child?</question>
      <answer>**Why are we recommending the 3‑P pain‑management plan for your teen?**

---

### 1. What the 3‑P approach actually is  
The “3‑P” strategy is a **comprehensive, evidence‑based way to help teens feel less pain** when they’re sick, injured, or going through a medical procedure. It combines three types of tools that work together, just like the three legs of a stool:

| **P** | **What it means** | **How it helps** |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Psychological** | Mind‑body tricks (distraction, guided imagery, breathing) | Keeps the teen’s mind focused on something other than pain, which can lower the sensation of pain and reduce anxiety. |
| **Physical** | Cold/heat packs, gentle movement, positioning | Reduces swelling, relaxes muscles, and can directly numb the painful area. |
| **Pharmacological** | Medications (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or stronger pain relievers if needed) | Provides the chemical “pain‑killer” effect that the body needs when pain is too intense for the other tools alone. |

### 2. Why this mix is especially good for teens

| **Reason** | **Why it matters for a teen** |
|------------|------------------------------|
| **Teens are still developing** | Their nervous system is more sensitive to pain and stress. Using a balanced approach helps protect their growing brains and bodies. |
| **They’re more likely to be active and engaged** | Distraction tools (video games, VR, music) tap into what teens enjoy, making pain relief feel less like a medical “treatment” and more like a normal part of the day. |
| **Reduces medication side‑effects** | By using non‑drug</answer>
