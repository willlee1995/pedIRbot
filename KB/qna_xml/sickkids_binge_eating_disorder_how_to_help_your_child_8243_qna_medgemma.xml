      <answer>**Why is treatment being recommended for your child?**

I’m glad you’re asking this question—understanding the “why” can help you feel more confident and involved in your child’s care.

| Why we recommend treatment | What it means for your child |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Binge‑Eating Disorder (BED) is a real medical condition** | BED isn’t just “eating too much.” It’s a pattern of eating that can cause physical health problems (e.g., high blood pressure, type‑2 diabetes) and emotional distress (e.g., shame, anxiety, depression). |
| **Early treatment improves outcomes** | The sooner we start, the less the disorder can affect your child’s growth, school performance, and relationships. |
| **Multidisciplinary care gives the best chance of recovery** | A team that includes a pediatrician, dietitian, therapist, and sometimes a psychiatrist can address all the ways BED shows up—body, mind, and behavior. |
| **Cognitive‑Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the proven first‑line treatment** | CBT helps your child recognize and change the thoughts and habits that lead to binges, learn healthier coping skills, and build a more balanced relationship with food. |
| **Family involvement is key** | Your support and understanding help your child feel safe, reduce shame, and create a home environment that encourages regular, balanced meals. |
| **Medication may help when mood disorders are present** | If your child also has depression or anxiety, a doctor might add an antidepressant. These can reduce the urge to binge and improve overall mood. |
| **We want to protect your child’s future health** | Untreated BED can lead to long‑term health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and ongoing mental health issues. Treatment helps prevent those complications. |

### What to expect
