      <answer>**Why is a bulimia‑related assessment and treatment being recommended for your child?**

I know this can feel overwhelming, but the goal of the evaluation is simply to make sure your child gets the right help at the right time. Below is a short, parent‑friendly explanation of why the medical team is suggesting this next step.

### 1. **What the assessment is looking for**

The “SickKids Bulimia Nervosa Signs &amp; Symptoms” review is a quick, structured check‑list that helps doctors spot the warning signs of bulimia in children and teens. It covers:

| What we look for | Why it matters |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Rapid eating or “food disappearing”** | Indicates binge episodes that can lead to stomach pain, acid reflux, or electrolyte imbalances. |
| **Eating alone, especially at night** | Shows that the child may be hiding binges, which can increase shame and isolation. |
| **Purging behaviors (vomiting, laxatives, diuretics)** | These can damage the esophagus, teeth, stomach lining, and cause dangerous low potassium or sodium levels. |
| **Irritability, mood swings, or concentration problems** | Nutrient gaps from binge‑purge cycles can affect brain chemistry and mood. |

### 2. **Why the medical team wants to act now**

1. **Preventing serious medical complications**  
   - Bulimia can cause dehydration, heart rhythm changes, and even life‑threatening electrolyte disturbances.  
   - Even if your child’s weight looks “normal,” the binge‑purge cycle can still harm organs and overall health.

2. **Early, less invasive treatment**  
   - The sooner we identify the pattern, the easier it is to use non‑invasive strategies (talk therapy, nutritional counseling, family support).  
   - Early intervention often means fewer</answer>
