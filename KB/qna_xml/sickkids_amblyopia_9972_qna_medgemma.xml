      <answer>**Why is your child being recommended treatment for amblyopia?**

I understand that hearing “treatment” can feel overwhelming, especially when it comes to your child’s vision. Below is a simple, honest explanation of why we’re recommending a plan for your child, and what it means for their future.

---

### 1. Amblyopia is a “lazy eye” that can become permanent if left untreated

- **Vision is still developing** – In children under 9, the brain and eyes are still learning to work together.  
- **If one eye is weaker, the brain starts to ignore it** – Over time, the weaker eye can become permanently “lazy,” meaning the child may never reach full visual potential in that eye.  
- **Early treatment is the best chance** – The earlier we intervene, the more likely the brain can “rewire” itself to use both eyes properly.

### 2. The treatment plan is tailored to what’s causing the problem

Your child’s amblyopia could be due to:

| Cause | Why it matters | Typical treatment |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Strabismus** (eyes mis‑aligned) | The brain rejects the image from the mis‑aligned eye | Patching, eye‑drops, or sometimes surgery |
| **Anisometropia** (different focusing power in each</answer>

      <question>What are the benefits and potential risks of the treatment?</question>
      <answer>**What the SickKids amblyopia treatment can do for your child**

| **Benefit** | What it means for your child |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Improved vision in the “lazy” eye** | Most children who receive treatment see a measurable gain in visual acuity (sharpness of vision) in the affected eye. The better the vision, the easier it is to read, play sports, and learn. |
| **Better depth perception** | When both eyes work together, your child can judge distances more accurately—important for catching a ball, climbing stairs, or riding a bike. |
| **Reduced risk of developing or worsening eye misalignment (strabismus)** | Untreated amblyopia can lead to the eyes turning in or out. Treating early helps keep the eyes aligned, which is easier to manage later if needed</answer>
