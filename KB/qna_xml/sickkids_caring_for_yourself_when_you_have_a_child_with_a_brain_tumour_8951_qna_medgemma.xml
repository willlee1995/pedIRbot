      <answer>**Why is treatment being recommended for your child?**

I know that hearing the word “treatment” can feel overwhelming, especially when it comes to a brain tumour. The decision to move forward is usually based on a few key reasons that are common to most children who need care for a brain tumour. Below I’ll explain those reasons in plain language, highlight what matters most for children, and let you know that every child’s situation is unique—so your medical team will tailor the plan to your child’s specific needs.

### 1. **Stopping the tumour from growing or spreading**

- **Tumours are abnormal cells** that can multiply and take over healthy brain tissue.  
- If left untreated, they can press on important parts of the brain, leading to headaches, seizures, weakness, vision problems, or changes in mood and behavior.  
- Treatment (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination) is aimed at **removing or shrinking the tumour** so that it no longer puts pressure on the brain or interferes with normal functions.

### 2. **Improving or preserving quality of life**

- Even if a tumour is not life‑threatening, it can still cause pain, fatigue, or difficulty with school and play.  
- By reducing tumour size or stopping its growth, treatment can **relieve symptoms** and help your child feel better and stay active.

### 3. **Maximizing chances of long‑term survival**

- For many brain tumours, early and aggressive treatment gives the best chance of keeping the child alive and healthy for many years.  
- The goal is not only to treat the tumour now but also to **prevent recurrence** in the future.
