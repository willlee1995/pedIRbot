# Document Chunking Explained

## The Problem You Discovered

You correctly identified that the system was **truncating** chunks instead of properly **splitting** them. This was causing significant data loss!

### What Was Happening (WRONG ❌)

```
Document (10,000 chars)
    ↓
Old paragraph-based chunking creates chunks of varying sizes
    ↓
Chunk 1: 500 chars ✓
Chunk 2: 3,500 chars 😱
Chunk 3: 6,000 chars 😱
    ↓
Embedding tries to embed 3,500 chars → TRUNCATES to 400 chars
    ↓
Result: Only first 400 chars embedded, 3,100 chars LOST! 💥
```

### What Happens Now (CORRECT ✅)

```
Document (10,000 chars)
    ↓
New sliding window chunking with hard size limit
    ↓
Chunk 1: 300 chars ✓
Chunk 2: 300 chars (with 50 char overlap from chunk 1) ✓
Chunk 3: 300 chars (with 50 char overlap from chunk 2) ✓
...
Chunk 40: 300 chars ✓
    ↓
All chunks embedded successfully
    ↓
Result: ALL content preserved and searchable! 🎉
```

## New Chunking Algorithm

### How It Works

1. **Sliding Window**: Moves through text in fixed-size windows
2. **Smart Boundaries**: Breaks at sentence/word boundaries when possible
3. **Hard Limit**: NEVER exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`
4. **Overlap**: Maintains context between chunks
5. **Bilingual**: Supports both English and Chinese sentence endings

### Code Flow

```python
# src/document_processor.py (line 155-225)

text = "Very long medical document..."
start = 0

while start < len(text):
    end = start + chunk_size  # e.g., start=0, end=300

    # Try to break at sentence ending
    sentence_end = find_sentence_boundary(text, start, end)
    if found:
        end = sentence_end

    # Extract chunk (NEVER exceeds chunk_size)
    chunk = text[start:end]  # Guaranteed ≤ 300 chars

    # Move forward with overlap
    start = end - overlap  # e.g., next start = 250
```

## Verification

### Before Re-ingesting

Run the verification script to check chunk sizes:

```bash
python scripts/verify_chunks.py KB/
```

Expected output:

```
CHUNK SIZE ANALYSIS
Total chunks: 245
Average size: 287.3 chars
Minimum size: 45 chars
Maximum size: 300 chars  ← Should NEVER exceed MAX_CHUNK_SIZE
Target max: 300 chars

✅ SUCCESS: All chunks are within the size limit!
```

### If You See This (BAD):

```
⚠️  WARNING: 127 chunks exceed MAX_CHUNK_SIZE!
Maximum size: 3500 chars
```

**Solution**: Make sure you have the latest `document_processor.py` code and re-run.

## Impact on Your Data

### Before Fix (Data Loss)

```
100 documents → 500 chunks
Average chunk created: 1,200 chars
Truncated to: 400 chars
Data loss: 66% of content lost! 😱
```

### After Fix (No Loss)

```
100 documents → 1,200 chunks (more chunks, smaller size)
Average chunk created: 285 chars
Truncated to: N/A (no truncation needed)
Data loss: 0% ✅
```

## Re-ingestion Required

**IMPORTANT**: You must re-ingest your documents to benefit from the fix!

```bash
# 1. Verify chunking is working correctly
python scripts/verify_chunks.py KB/

# 2. If all chunks are within limit, proceed with ingestion
python scripts/ingest_documents.py KB/ --reset

# 3. Test the results
python test_chat.py
```

## What to Expect

### During Ingestion

**Old (incorrect) logs**:

```
WARNING: Text truncated from 3369 to 400 chars  ← Data loss!
WARNING: Text truncated from 4468 to 400 chars  ← Data loss!
```

**New (correct) logs**:

```
INFO: Created 45 chunks from document.pdf (avg: 287 chars, max: 300 chars) ✓
INFO: Processing batch 1/5
# No truncation warnings! ✓
```

### Embedding Performance

With `embeddinggemma` and `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE=300`:

- **Chunk creation**: More chunks, but proper size
- **Embedding**: No context length errors
- **No truncation**: All content preserved
- **Better retrieval**: More granular chunks = better precision

## Configuration Guidelines

### For embeddinggemma

```bash
# .env
MAX_CHUNK_SIZE=300    # Safe limit
CHUNK_OVERLAP=50      # 16% overlap
```

This gives you:

- ~33 chunks per 10,000-char document
- Each chunk: 250-300 chars
- 50-char overlap between chunks
- No data loss

### For Larger Models

```bash
# .env
MAX_CHUNK_SIZE=512    # Can go higher
CHUNK_OVERLAP=100     # More overlap
```

## Quality Assurance Checklist

After re-ingestion, verify:

- [ ] Run `python scripts/verify_chunks.py KB/`
- [ ] Check max chunk size ≤ `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`
- [ ] No truncation warnings during embedding
- [ ] Test retrieval: `python test_chat.py`
- [ ] Ask test questions and verify answer quality

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing truncation warnings?

```bash
# 1. Check your .env
cat .env | grep MAX_CHUNK_SIZE
# Should show: MAX_CHUNK_SIZE=300

# 2. Verify it's loaded
python -c "from config import settings; print(settings.max_chunk_size)"
# Should print: 300

# 3. Clear and re-ingest
rm -rf chroma_db  # or delete chroma_db folder
python scripts/ingest_documents.py KB/ --reset
```

### Chunks still too large?

If `verify_chunks.py` shows oversized chunks, the document_processor.py file might not have the updated code. Re-download or manually verify lines 155-225.

## Technical Details

### Why Sliding Window is Better

**Old paragraph-based approach**:

- Respects paragraph boundaries (good for semantics)
- But can create huge chunks if paragraphs are long (bad for embedding models)
- No guarantee on chunk size

**New sliding window approach**:

- Enforces hard size limits (required for embedding)
- Still tries to break at sentence boundaries (good for semantics)
- Guaranteed chunk size ≤ MAX_CHUNK_SIZE
- Overlap maintains context

### Bilingual Support

The new chunker recognizes both English and Chinese sentence endings:

- **English**: `.`, `!`, `?`
- **Chinese**: `。`, `！`, `？`
- **Fallback**: Word boundaries (spaces)
- **Hard limit**: Character position if no boundary found

## Summary

### What Changed

1. **Document chunking** now enforces HARD size limits
2. **Embedding** truncation is now a safety fallback (should rarely happen)
3. **Verification script** lets you check before ingesting
4. **Better logging** shows avg/max chunk sizes

### What You Need to Do

```bash
# 1. Verify the fix
python scripts/verify_chunks.py KB/

# 2. Re-ingest with proper chunking
python scripts/ingest_documents.py KB/ --reset

# 3. Test quality
python test_chat.py
```

---

**Result**: No more data loss! All content is properly chunked and embedded. ✅
